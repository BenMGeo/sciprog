A word of warning: you NEED to practice in between the lectures. Otherwise you will get lost.

All lecture material is provided as [jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org). You can directly view it here within GitHub, but can also clone them and play around with them. Any feedback and corrections are welcome as pull requests.
